Released in 1995, this is the original source code to the Microsoft 3D Movie Maker project, now released
under the [MIT license](LICENSE) as open source.

## Building instructions

### Easy Mode

Updated to compile with with VS 2022 on Windows 10/11 (thanks to [Clemens Wasser](https://github.com/clemenswasser/Microsoft-3D-Movie-Maker), Bjork)

If you have Windows 10, you may need to install [PowerShell 7](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.2).

Just launch a "Native Tools Command Prompt for VS" (preferably x86, as porting to 64-bit is WIP and might not work) and build:
```powershell
pwsh .\build.ps1
```

### Advanced
To get it properly working, we need the proper BRender, Audioman and SoftImage libraries, that are currently missing.
This project is unlikely to build successfully under modern hardware/software, but you can get started with compilation and get partial completed binaries. Here's what will get you going. Thanks to Mac Sample for their work on getting this far!

- Make sure this repo is checked out to a folder with a short name, ideally right on the root of a drive (i.e. C:\3d).
- You will need Visual C++ 2.1's dev tools (located under MSVC21\BIN on its installer disk) on your path. Modern compilers dislike some of the pre C++98 conventions.
- Set these environment variables:
  - set MSVCNT_ROOT=C:\msvc21
  - set PATH=%MSVCNT_ROOT%\bin;%PATH%;
  - set INCLUDE=%MSVCNT_ROOT%\include
  - set LIB=%MSVCNT_ROOT%\lib
- From the root of this repo, run ```setvars.bat``` you can change the values in this script to change what your build will target.
  - Environment variables used by the build:
    - SOC_ROOT: Path to root of repo (where this README.md is)
    - KAUAI_ROOT: Path to Kauai: %SOC_ROOT%\kauai
    - ARCH: Operating system to build for
      - WIN: Windows
      - MAC: Macintosh 68k
    - INCLUDE: Set to the MSVC include directories, plus:
      - %SOC_ROOT%\INC
      - %SOC_ROOT%\BREN\INC
      - %SOC_ROOT%\SRC
      - %KAUAI_ROOT%\SRC
    - UNICODE: If set to non-empty, build Unicode instead of ANSI
    - TYPE: Sets build type
      - DAY: Debug, incremental (daily?)
      - HOME: Debug, not incremental
      - SHIP: Release
      - DBSHIP: Release, with linker debug output
    - BLD_TYPE_DIR: Name of directory under OBJ to place binaries. **This will be set automatically by the Kauai makefiles.**
      - WINS for ANSI release builds
      - WINUS for Unicode release builds
      - WIND for ANSI debug builds
      - WINUD for Unicode debug builds
    - CHIP: Set to use optimized assembly language implementations of some functions in Kauai
      - IN_80386: Intel 80386
      - MC_68020: Motorola 68020 (for Macintosh)
      - If not set, just use the C implementation
- Locate and place font files (see [FONTS.md](FONTS.md))
- Build Kauai
  - `cd %SOC_ROOT%\kauai`
  - `nmake all`
- Build 3D Movie Maker
  - `cd %SOC_ROOT%`
  - `nmake all`
- Create a distribution directory that will be usable as-is
  - `nmake dist`
- Now you can run 3DMOVIE.EXE in the "dist" subdirectory and it should run without errors.

### Known Issues

- Compilation of `SITOBREN.EXE` is disabled
  - This requires the SoftImage SDK "DKIT" to compile


## Contributing

The source files in this repo are for historical reference and will be kept static, and this repository will
be archived. Feel free to fork this repo and experiment.

## Code cleanup

This code was restored from the Microsoft corporate archives and cleared for release.

- Developer names and aliases were removed, with the exception of current employees who worked on the
  original release who consented to keeping their names in place
- The archive consisted of several CDs, some of which were for alternate builds or products, and
  have been excluded
- The code does not build with today's engineering tools, and is released as-is.

This repo includes a build from 1995 of BRender from Argonaut software. Approval to open source BRender as MIT was given in an email from Jez San, former CEO of Argonaut. Other versions of BRender exist at https://github.com/foone/BRender-v1.3.2 and https://github.com/foone/BRender-1997 Thanks to Jez and the whole BRender team for their hard work on this amazing engine. A full historical list of BRender contributors is available at https://github.com/foone/BRender-v1.3.2/blob/main/README.md 

This repo does NOT include the SoftImage SDK "./DKIT" from 1992.

Jez also offered this interesting BRender anecdote in an email:

```
When Sam Littlewood designed BRender, he didnâ€™t write the code. And then document it.  
The way most things were built at the time.
First, he wrote the manual.  The full documentation
That served as the spec.  Then the coding started.
```
