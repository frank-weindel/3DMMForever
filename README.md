## Building instructions

Updated to compile with with VS 2022 on Windows 10/11 (thanks to [Clemens Wasser](https://github.com/clemenswasser/Microsoft-3D-Movie-Maker))

If you have Windows 10, you may need to install [PowerShell 7](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.2).

Just launch a "Native Tools Command Prompt for VS" (preferably x86, as porting to 64-bit is WIP and might not work) and build:
```powershell
pwsh .\build.ps1
```

## Code cleanup

This code was restored from the Microsoft corporate archives and cleared for release.

- Developer names and aliases were removed, with the exception of current employees who worked on the
  original release who consented to keeping their names in place
- The archive consisted of several CDs, some of which were for alternate builds or products, and
  have been excluded
- The code does not build with today's engineering tools, and is released as-is.

This repo includes a build from 1995 of BRender from Argonaut software. Approval to open source BRender as MIT was given in an email from Jez San, former CEO of Argonaut. Other versions of BRender exist at https://github.com/foone/BRender-v1.3.2 and https://github.com/foone/BRender-1997 Thanks to Jez and the whole BRender team for their hard work on this amazing engine. A full historical list of BRender contributors is available at https://github.com/foone/BRender-v1.3.2/blob/main/README.md 

This repo does NOT include the SoftImage SDK "./DKIT" from 1992.

Jez also offered this interesting BRender anecdote in an email:

```
When Sam Littlewood designed BRender, he didnâ€™t write the code. And then document it.  
The way most things were built at the time.
First, he wrote the manual.  The full documentation
That served as the spec.  Then the coding started.
```
